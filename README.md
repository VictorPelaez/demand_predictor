# Electricity demand predictor 

This project train some Deep Neural Networks to predict daily Spanish electricity demand.
Gets daily demand dataset from [REE](https://www.ree.es/es/apidatos#request)

You can test and play with the network parameters by running the jupyter notebook called [electricity_sp_demand_predictor.ipynb](electricity_sp_demand_predictor.ipynb) in Google colab. Also modify dates (`start_date` and `end_date`) to get recent data.
